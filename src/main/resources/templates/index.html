  Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
  It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

  To set up a production-ready React build environment, follow these instructions:
  * https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html
  * https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-an-existing-app.html

  You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
  * https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html
  * https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html
